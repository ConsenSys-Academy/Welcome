# Community Contributor Guidelines

Hi there! Thanks for helping us keep these materials fresh and up-to-date. A few guidelines we'd appreciate you reading before you start hacking away:

* Be sure to [fork](https://github.com/how-to-fork) the repo and issue all changes as Pull Requests
* Be careful about changing links, there is code in there which allows the window to open in a new tab, don't delete it!
